How to write documentation
################################

First, you should read `the ReST primer <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_.

Encoding
*************

Only UTF-8 without BOM, Unix LF.

Sections
**************

We use the standard sections:

* # with overline, for parts
* \* with overline, for chapters
* =, for sections
* -, for subsections
* ^, for subsubsections
* ", for paragraphs

Folders
**************

Structure to be determined.

Images
***************

Images should be png and placed in a "media" directory at the root of the repository. If needed sources should be included in the same place with the same name.

Images should have an explicit name.
